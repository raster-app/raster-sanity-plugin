## Configuration

3. Note your organization ID

### 2. Add the Plugin to Your Sanity Config

// sanity.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "sanity";
import { rasterPlugin } from "@monogram/sanity-plugin-raster";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...other config
  plugins: [
    // ...other plugins
    rasterPlugin({
      apiKey: "your-raster-api-key",
      orgId: "your-organization-id",
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Usage

### Basic Schema Example

```typescript
// schemas/blogPost.ts
import { defineType } from "sanity";

export default defineType({
  name: "blogPost",
  title: "Blog Post",
  type: "document",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      title: "Title",
      type: "string",
      validation: (Rule) => Rule.required(),
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      title: "Description",
      type: "text",
      rows: 3,
    },
    {
      name: "featuredImage",
      title: "Featured Image",
      type: "image",
      description: "Select an image from Raster",
    },
  ],
});
```

### Using the Image in Your Frontend

The image field will store the URL and alt text. Here's how the data structure looks:

```typescript
interface RasterImage {
  _type: "image";
  asset: {
    url: string;
  };
  alt?: string;
}
```

Example usage in Next.js:

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      {post.featuredImage && (
        <Image
          src={post.featuredImage.asset.url}
          alt={post.featuredImage.alt || ""}
          width={1200}
          height={630}
        />
      )}
      <p>{post.description}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```
